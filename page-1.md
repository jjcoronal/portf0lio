This documentary delves into the complex interplay of waste perception, social behavior, and systemic design in De Wallen, Amsterdam. By spotlighting the visible waste issue through a socio-technical lens, the film explores how historical infrastructure and modern consumption collide to create challenges—and opportunities—for cleaner urban environments.

Due to the numerous challenges surrounding waste management in De Wallen, and because we know that policymakers and researchers are working hard to find solutions, we wanted to assist them in a valuable way. Our field research revealed that having a tangible means to discuss and clearly indicate the issues with waste would be extremely helpful. Furthermore, it became apparent that the municipality does not yet have a visual overview of how the waste system operates in reality and where the challenges lie. This led us to create the system map and typology matrix, which seek to translate reality into a physical representation of what is happening on the streets.
