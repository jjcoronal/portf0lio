## About me

> I take a **multidisciplinary approach** that integrates theoretical inquiry, design experimentation, and real-world applications, bridging abstract concepts with practical, impactful solutions. My work is driven by a deep sensitivity to **cultural narratives**, **human experience**, and **systemic inequalities**, fostering a commitment to rethinking spatial practices, challenging colonial legacies, and envisioning more inclusive futures in design and urbanism.

# Multidisciplinary Collaborations


### [Clean Inner City Living Lab](page-1.md)

The research highlights the gaps between the design of the waste management system and its real-world application, particularly in how waste is perceived and managed in the area. Using a socio-technical systems framework, the misalignments between social behaviors, technical infrastructure, and waste management processes are identified.

# Urban Research Projects

### [The Ex[cease]tance](page2.md)

The Exceasetance engages with the logistics of burial and its embedded power structures, critically examinining Western funerary practices through a Mexican cultural lens.
It envisions new discourses of designing alternative spatial strategies for death and remembrance beyond colonial narratives.

### [Raindrops of Change](page3.md)

Decolonial Niche Innovations seeks to challenge the dominant paradigms of infrastructure and technological development by centering non-Western knowledge systems.
Through this lens, it explores alternative design methodologies that resist extractivist and capitalist models, offering a roadmap for decolonial futures.

# Research & Design Projects

### [Wood Prototyping, Fabrication, & Community Engagement](page8.md)

Conceiving the use of wood, through forest use and maintenance, as an alternative material for construction, the present research and design project seeks to establish a closer dialogue between unskilled labor, the architect and digital design.

### [Tensegrity Pavilion â€“ Digital Prototyping & Experimental Research](page9.md)

The research unfolded through a non-linear iterative process, seamlessly integrating digital experimentation with the creation of physical prototypes. This dynamic approach fostered a deeper understanding of the design's behavior and material properties, allowing for constant feedback and refinement.

### [Codified Reinterpretation](page10.md)

From a reinterpretation of the creative process and the work of the North American artist Chuck Close, the geometric bases on which his discourse is built were abstracted and translated into the Python programming language.
