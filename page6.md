# UnmuteCommute
#### _MSc. MADE - Joint course project_
###### _Metropolitan Data 2 & Entrepreneurial Skills_

Unmute Commute explores mobility, social interaction, and behavioral change from an entrepreneurial and data-driven perspective. The initiative combines physical tokens (bracelets) with a digital engagement platform, providing commuters with a low-effort, opt-in method to signal their openness to conversation.


The analysis used GIS analysis to identify high-potential commuter hubs, balancing scientific research, urban mobility studies, and marketing tactics to craft a scalable, human-centered product.

Small-scale trials, GIS-based location analysis, and structured interviews were carried out in order to refine the design, functionality, and marketing strategy.

Through an iterative entrepreneurial process, the project evolved from a disruption alert system to a human-centered intervention that transforms transit waiting time into a moment for meaningful interaction.
